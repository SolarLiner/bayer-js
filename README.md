# Bayer

Reactive server abstractions library for Node.js.

## What it is

Bayer is a reactive library that abstracts away the difficulty of setting up a
Node.js server with common-case features. It uses `rxjs` handle data-flow, as it
is basically the textbook use-case of reactive programming.

### Modular

As its smallest, Bayer provides you with an Observable, providing
`IncomingMessage` and `ServerResponse` parameters from Node's HTTP server
library.

Bayer can easily be extended through the use of Middlewares, they're
`OperatorFunction`s that get piped to the main request Observable.
They can be as simple or as complex, and benefit from all the power of the RxJS
Operators.

### Easy

While being introduced to Reactive programming will make your life easier, the
project aims to make writing feature-complete servers as easy and as quick as
possible. If you need a "quickstart template" that's more than 50 lines of code
when creating a new project, then this project's purpose has been defeated.

## What it isn't

Bayer isn't batteries included; it won't do _everything_ for you. However, the
project tries to strike a balance between minimalism and availability of
features.

Note that because Bayer has been designed with modularity in mind, functionality
can easily be added through the use of middlewares.

## Why the name "Bayer"?

Because I was listening to Andrew Bayer's album when initially building the
project, and that it's a cool name, and because the JavaScript community needs
some [beautiful music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfiL-tyMHyI).

<sup>But if you ask me, [this version]() is much better üòù</sup>
